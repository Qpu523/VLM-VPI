GPT-4o PERCEPTION & PREDICTION:
VISUAL_ANALYSIS: A young girl is located in the front-left area of the ego vehicle, standing near the roadside. The pedestrian remains stationary and does not step into the roadway, clearly yielding to the approaching vehicle.

KINEMATIC_ANALYSIS: The pedestrian exhibits no observable movement, indicating near-zero velocity. The distance between the pedestrian and the ego vehicle is relatively large, measured at 35.8629 meters, suggesting no immediate interaction risk.

DECISION: Pedestrian Yielding

REASON: The pedestrian remains stationary and does not show any intention to enter the roadway. Both visual cues and kinematic information indicate yielding behavior, allowing the ego vehicle to proceed safely without requiring evasive action.
