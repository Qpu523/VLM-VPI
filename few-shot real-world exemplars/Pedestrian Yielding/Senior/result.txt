GPT-4o PERCEPTION & PREDICTION:
VISUAL_ANALYSIS: An elderly pedestrian is located in the front-left area of the ego vehicle, standing near the roadside. Throughout the entire observation period, the pedestrian remains stationary and does not step into the roadway, clearly yielding to the ego vehicle.

KINEMATIC_ANALYSIS: The pedestrian exhibits no observable movement, indicating near-zero velocity. The distance between the pedestrian and the ego vehicle is measured at 8.5435 meters, suggesting a stable spatial separation with no immediate crossing intent.

DECISION: Pedestrian Yielding

REASON: The pedestrian consistently maintains a stationary posture and shows no intention to enter the roadway. Both visual evidence and kinematic information confirm yielding behavior, allowing the ego vehicle to proceed safely without requiring any evasive or deceleration maneuvers.
