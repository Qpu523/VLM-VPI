GPT-4o PERCEPTION & PREDICTION:
VISUAL_ANALYSIS: The pedestrian located at the left front of the ego vehicle is an elderly individual with white hair, wearing black pants, and is actively crossing the street within the crosswalk. The pedestrian’s posture and forward movement indicate a committed road-crossing behavior in front of the vehicle.

KINEMATIC_ANALYSIS: The pedestrian’s velocity components are ped_vx = -2.1614 m/s and ped_vy = -0.9166 m/s, indicating a relatively brisk and continuous walking motion. The current distance between the pedestrian and the ego vehicle is 7.7628 meters, placing the pedestrian within a close interaction range and indicating an imminent crossing conflict.

DECISION: Pedestrian Non-Yielding

REASON: The pedestrian is actively crossing the roadway with sustained speed and does not exhibit signs of hesitation or yielding. The kinematic evidence, combined with the pedestrian’s position directly in the vehicle’s path, suggests a clear intention to continue crossing ahead of the ego vehicle.
